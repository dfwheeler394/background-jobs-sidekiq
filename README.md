Intro: Why Use Background Jobs?
Keeping response times down are important to keep a website running quickly. Time intensive requests are resource-intensive on the server, and create bad user experiences. Background jobs are able to handle backend requests while still allowing a responsive, real-time user experience.  

Sidekiq: Uses Redis to queue background jobs. Redis is an in-memory data store so itâ€™s very fast. Sidekiq adds complexity to infrastructure because Redis needs to be added.

By Default, Sidekiq checks enqueued jobs every 5 seconds. 

To enqueue first job:
1) launch Rails Console in Terminal with 'Rails c' command
2) Once in Rails Console, enter 'FakeJob.perform_later'
